					p This is a tool used to aid with learning material for the course KOREA 101R at the Renison University College. The material draws from the book, #[em Dr. Kim's Korean for Complete Beginners] by Young G. Kim. There are several interactive exercises in this application to target specific skills. Each exercise has subsections with different sets of words. 
					p The #[i Dictation] exercises target your listening skills. You will listen to a snippet of audio that can be repeated as many times as you wish, then type the correct word associated with the snippet.
					p The #[i Translate] exercises are broken into two categories: English->Korean and Korean->English. In each category, you will be given a word in one language and must translate it to the other.
					p The #[i Grammar] exercises will target your ability to conjugate verbs and use the appropriate particles. You will be given sentences containing blanks that you are to fill with the appropriate characters.
