			h4 Introductory Korean Language Course Aid
			p This is a tool used to aid with learning material for the course KOREA 101R at the Renison University College. There are several interactive exercises in this application to target specific skills. Each exercise has subsections with different sets of words. 
			p The #[i Dictation] exercises target your listening skills. You will listen to a snippet of audio that can be repeated as many times as you wish, then type the correct word associated with the snippet.
			p The #[i Translate] exercises are broken into two categories: English->Korean and Korean->English. In each category, you will be given a word in one language and must translate it to the other.
			p The #[i Grammar] exercises will target your ability to conjugate verbs and use the appropriate particles. You will be given sentences containing blanks that you are to fill with the appropriate characters.
